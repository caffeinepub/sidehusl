# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Home page hero to prominently promote the AI App Builder with a new exact headline, more striking high-contrast styling, and a primary CTA that routes to `/builder`.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the Home page hero H1 text with exactly: "SIDEHUSL AI, BUILD YOUR SIDE HUSTLE TODAY!"
- Update hero supporting copy/badge/subheadline and CTA labels to promote the AI App Builder in English.
- Set the primary hero CTA button to navigate to `/builder`, while keeping any secondary CTAs working as they do today.
- Increase hero visual emphasis via higher-contrast overlay/gradient and vivid accent highlights while preserving the existing full-bleed background image pattern, readability, responsiveness, and light/dark mode behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a bolder, high-contrast Home page hero promoting the AI App Builder, with a primary button that takes them directly to the Builder page.
