No coding required.”) renders first, above the “AI-Powered App Builder” label and above the CTA buttons. Update hero container/section layout classes to top-align the hero content within the hero area (e.g., adjust flex alignment and top padding/margins) with responsive spacing so it sits as high as practical on mobile and desktop while remaining readable and visually balanced. Preserve existing overlay/gradient layers and keep CTA buttons and navigation behavior unchanged."
