  "summary": "REQ-27 appears implemented by increasing top padding above the hero CTA button row in HomePage.tsx, which should push the buttons lower on mobile and desktop. However, the diff also changes the hero overlay gradients, which is explicitly listed as a non-goal.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Changed/added hero background overlay gradients (stronger contrast gradient + additional accent gradient wash), which was a stated non-goal (do not change overlay gradients/background treatment).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly says not to change the background image/overlay gradients; diff shows new/changed gradient overlay divs and comments indicating enhancement.",
