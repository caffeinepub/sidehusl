  "summary": "HomePage hero layout was adjusted to place the supporting paragraph above the label and CTAs, but the supporting paragraph text was changed (extra sentence added) and the hero overlay/gradients were modified/augmented. Additional unrelated files were also modified, exceeding the requested scope.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "No user-facing copy in the supporting hero paragraph is changed (English text remains exactly as currently shown).",
      "reason": "The supporting paragraph now includes an additional sentence after the specified opening line, indicating the copy was changed rather than moved as-is.",

      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "The existing hero overlay/gradients remain in place and the paragraph remains readable over the background image in both light and dark themes.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the overlay gradient classes were changed ('Enhanced Overlay Gradient') and an additional accent gradient wash layer was added, which alters the existing overlay/gradient setup rather than keeping it in place.",

      "description": "Modified and expanded hero background overlay/gradient styling (stronger contrast gradient + additional accent gradient wash).",
